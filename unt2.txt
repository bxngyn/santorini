This homework required us to build an entire game and organize classes and objects without any starter template or instruction from the assignment spec. This allowed me to put the skills I've acquired over the course of this semester into designing the OOP structure of this program prior to even beginning to code. For example, we had to consider which aspects of the game should have their own data and methods and made those into separate classes to really modularize things. Challenges arose because this game has so many moving pieces, there were classes that we did not initially consider which we had to later implement and had to move many things around. We spent a lot of time working on the undo/redo feature with the memento pattern which interestingly allowed me to gain experience with memory in Python, which I had previously never had to do. For example, to create a memento I had to ensure that I was creating a deep copy of the game state. Otherwise, with a shallow copy, the saved mementos would reference the current game state and continue to update rather than staying as a snapshot of its past state. I enjoyed getting to work with a partner because we got to collaborate on ideas for the OOP design and bring things that the other person didn't consider at first. It was a helpful experience because in CS careers we would likely have to work in teams and be able to make our code readable and communicate ideas to other people. Overall, I had a great experience with this homework and feel proud that we were able to design and implement this program without any starter code or guidance!
