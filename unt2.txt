- Displaying the players on the board
- Translated direction into movement
- Worker move + build functionality
    - Checking if a cell is valid (in bounds and no worker occupying) before moving or building there
- Checking if a worker cannot move + checking if a player has lost if both workers cannot move
- Memento

This homework required us to build an entire game and organize classes and objects without any starter template or instruction 
from the assignment spec. This allowed me to put the skills I've acquired over the course of this semester into designing the OOP 
structure of this program. For example, I had to consider which aspects of the game should have their own data and methods and
made those into separate classes for encapsulation.
Since I was responsible for implementing the undo/redo feature, I gained experience working with the memento design pattern.
