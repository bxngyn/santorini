[x] 7 points Display the board as a grid of buttons showing the buildings and workers graphically on each button.  A representation like the one used in the CLI is acceptable to continue on to other parts of this assignment, but for full points here, the levels of the building should be shown visually and the worker should be shown standing on the building. I have seen several interesting ways to represent this, so be creative.
